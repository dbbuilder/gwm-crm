R3 Win Center is an end-to-end, opportunity management system designed specifically to serve federal government contractors. It brings the information work of GD, capture, and proposal development together into a seamless work environment. A robust integration with G1IQ eliminates the manual work of opportunity sourcing and updates to enable you to focus on the opportunity work that adds value towards winning business. Through this video you'll see how Win Center brings it all together. At the heart of Win Center is Opportunity Management. This opportunity dashboard shows ops based upon the GugCon standard of a phase-based life cycle for phases 1 through 6 and award results. What you do in Win Center is for the purpose of driving opportunities into and through this life cycle. Let's pop up an opportunity. This opportunity reconvues where you work on an opportunity. It brings together the information work for BD, capture, and proposal team members. You have everyone working off the same page throughout the opportunity life cycle. For Gublin ops such as this one, you have the data brought in from Gublin that gets changed along the way. And you have Gublin documents that are updated automatically. You do your pursued activities which ripple out to dashboards and reports. And you drive work across your organization and to partners using action items, each with their own collaborative workspace and workflow, and document assignments, leveraging a robust document management feature set. We'll show you doing some work later in the video. But first, the Gublin IQ ops have to get from Gublin into the pipeline. Let's show you how we make the opportunity on ramp efficient and effective for BD. We're in phase 0 on the BD tab. This is where you work ops that have been sourced from Gublin. There are three ways to source Gublin opportunities that show in this schematic of the on ramp process. You can mark individual opportunities as you review them. You can also set up searches with filters to automatically identify matching ops and feed them into Wincenter. This is a no-touch feed. Third, you can receive feeds from Gublin toons. This service provides feeds from 50 plus GWAC and IDIQ vehicles. Again, no touch required. Now every five minutes, Wincenter checks Gubwin for new source opportunities and updates. New source stops show up in phase 0 to be reviewed, worked, and pushed into the pipeline. Phase 0 lists your Gublin IQ ops that were marked by one or more people and the ops it just show up for feeds. Each phase 0 ops has a pop-up workspace. You have all the Gublin data that was automatically imported. Send the documents at your fingertips. You review the ops, distribute them to others, collaborate, and make your initial interest decision. Those that are go get pushed into the Wincenter pipeline using the Add to Pipeline Work Flow Action. Now we'll return to Opportunity Management to do some work. This lifecycle can ban is a powerful way to manage your pipeline. The board organizes your ops visually based upon the phase-based lifecycle. We have other Cambian boards for bid logs by time frame and submission tracking. They're powerful because they give you situational awareness. Addic Lans. You can use quick filters to focus in on certain ops. You can expand all of the Cambian cards to see key opportunity details. The stoplights are the most recent pursuit assessment KPIs. Addic Lans then form you where and up stands. Also, each opportunity has key visual indicators to give you real-time status. For instance, note that some opportunities have a yellow lightning bolt. This indicates that there's a Gublin IQ update. When you pop up the opportunity, you see a banner for the update. An update can contain data and or documents. Documents are automatically updated for you. Data is not. Instead, we provide a red line view showing you the new Gublin data and red compared to your existing data in black. You have a choice. You can choose to accept the update changes or reject them or just make selective edits. We'll accept the update. You no longer have to check Gublin for updates, manually update data and documents, worry about missing something or worry that Gublin, who's not always right, is overriding your data. Now let's do some opportunity pursuit work. Here's the pursuit activity checklist. The opposite in the pursuit phase, the activities equate to Shipley steps for capture and proposal activities in your pursuit. A Gubcon best practice. It's auto populated from your organization's process master list. You don't have to enter them. Use this to guide users on next steps. Collaborate and track the progress. We'll complete an activity and we'll look forward to the activities for pre-proposal. Activity progress is scored to support your P-Win analysis. Of course, you'll want to work your contacts. Here you can track contact activity and make comments. Your activity is automatically reflected in our centralized account manager. Another Gubcon pursuit best practice is to have standard pursuit assessments. We provide a KPI-based assessment feature using nine standard Gubcon KPIs with guides for stoplight ratings. Here you have a running history for the app. The most recent assessment appears in the campaign. In other reports, it is also a score. And you drive the opportunity through the lifecycle process using our configurable workflow actions in the upper right. Now let's take a look at reporting focused on the pipeline. Our pursuit assessments display provides you with a roll-up of the most recent pursuit assessments for all active ops. It enables you to quickly spot ops with a problem and take action, including scene ops without any assessment. Not good. And here we have our pipeline analysis report. It uses ripple analytics to update your phase milestones and health scores in real time. We provide three factors to evaluate op-pursuit health, including the P-Win which is subjective, the score of the last pursuit assessment, and the pursuit activity progress score. You can also get a broad picture using our pipeline chart dashboard. It's interactive with charts that incorporate analytics such as P-Win waiting of opportunity value, bubble charts comparing P-Win and pursuit assessment score, and breakdowns. For more general reporting, the workhorse is our grid-style tag-of-reports at Slice and Dice all information across WInCenter. It comes with a set of 40 reports. You can customize them or create your own. You can search, group, filter, do calculations, and even format information. You can print the results or export to Excel, Word, or PDF. Our reporting gives you rich real-time visibility. It's just one way that WInCenter works to serve up information. However, winning federal business is a broad team effort. It involves participants from across the organization and working with external partners. Our at-year service features make it simpler and easier for all participants to play their role in WInCenter. For instance, we have a set of my work features on the home tab. One is my action items. WInCenter serves up all the open action items assigned to you or the you've assigned to others across all opportunities. Here we see the work for a contract manager. They do all their work right here, and WInCenter takes care of the workflow, email notifications, and updates. Partners have it easy also. They work in a separate secure partner portal. They just have access to the apps that they're teamed on. What they can see and do is restricted. WInCenter serves up information and assigned action items and documents. They can do their work and collaborate with you right from here. Can work be any easier than what we've seen already? Yes. By making work more convenient for all participants. You can do this by enabling them to just work in Microsoft Teams using WInCenter Snaplets. Imagine that you're an IDAQ program manager responsible for C-Port Next Gen Ops. Here we've snapped into WInCenter Phase Zero display showing just C-Port opportunities. The Tune service feeds them to Gubwin, which filters them based upon your criteria, and WInCenter serves them up to you right here. You do your work just as you would in WInCenter, simple, easy, and super convenient. With WInCenter at your service, all participants are kept informed and engaged. It's just a better way to work to win federal business. Are you now ready to eliminate the manual work and keep everyone focused on work that adds value to winning business?
