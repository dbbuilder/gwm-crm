In this video we'll take a look at the R3 Auto Import for Gov. IQ. This feature automatically imports the data and documents of selected Gov. IQ opportunities into WinCenter. It's now simple and easy to get to work on opportunities. This is how the whole BD lifecycle process lays out. The opportunities are selected in Gov. IQ. Every five minutes WinCenter will pull selected opportunity data and documents into the system. They go into a Phase 0 bucket. You can work the opportunities to make an interest decision. Then when ready you push the opportunity into the Active WinCenter pipeline. From there you work them through the phases of the BD lifecycle in WinCenter. Along the way WinCenter will continue to be updated with Gov. IQ changes. Let's see it in action. Here we are in Gov. IQ. We've searched for opportunities with the key word satellite and that are pre-RFP. Now we'll drill into the opportunity. To select it for import you click the Add to Web Services download on the left. That's it. You're able to select any opportunities in Gov. IQ including those that are fed into it from Gov. services such as tunes, the task order opportunity notification system. The opportunity is then added to the Web Services download list for download and import. You can see it by going to the My Gov.1 and Web Services download. Note that all Gov. IQ users are able to select opportunities for import. You'll get fed into this one download list. When the opportunities are imported into WinCenter each will show who selected it based upon the Gov.1 ID. Once you make an opportunity selection you're done. WinCenter then takes over. It will auto import the opportunity dead end documents in the background. You can set the frequency of time such as daily, hourly or even five minutes. You do this once for the full system. After the initial import it will continue to update the information when changes are made to the opportunity in Gov.1. Now let's flip over to the WinCenter side. Here we are. After the background auto import you will see the imported opportunities in this Gov. IQ Import View. Think of this view as phase zero of the life cycle. They are in WinCenter but not yet moved into the formal opportunity life cycle pipeline. You can work on the ops. Each has a record view as shown here. It shows the Gov. IQ data on the details tab. We bring over all of the fields of information from Gov.1. No more retiping. You can easily view this information right here. And we bring over all of the documents as they're shown here. You can make comments distributed to others to review, make decisions, all depending on your phase zero needs. When you're ready you then push the opportunity into the WinCenter pipeline. To do this you just run the add to pipeline action. Here I have a form where I can add the business unit. You can have other fields that you may want to use to enhance the opportunity record in the pipeline. After running the action WinCenter will then set up the opportunity workspace and configure it for you to begin work. Now let's take a look at the full WinCenter opportunity life cycle pipeline. It's organized by GovCon life cycle phase. You can see that the imported opportunity is here. To get working just pop up the WinCenter opportunity record view by clicking on the title. Here you can see that the Gov. IQ information is already here. And there is a Gov. IQ tab that shows the current documents that have been imported. You can now begin working the opportunity. During the opportunities life cycle WinCenter will continually check Gov. IQ for new updates including new documents. They will then automatically appear on the Gov. IQ tab here in the active opportunity. It's that simple. Select the opportunity WinCenter imports it. Then push it into the WinCenter pipeline. Just two simple steps and you're off and working.
