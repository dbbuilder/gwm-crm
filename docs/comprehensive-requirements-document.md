## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive **multi-tenant SaaS** CRM system focused on **opportunity management** - specifically for tracking and managing government contracting opportunities that have been selected for pursuit. The system will be built using modern technologies (PostgreSQL, pgBouncer, Prisma, tRPC, React with shadcn UI) with **FedRAMP compliance** to provide a cost-effective alternative to expensive solutions while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality.

**Key System Focus**: This is NOT a master opportunities database. This system manages opportunities that clients discover on our separate company platform and then migrate into this CRM system for pursuit management, with continuous synchronization to our internal opportunity intelligence API.

**Key Architectural Decisions**:
- **Multi-tenant SaaS**: Supports 500+ users per tenant, 1000+ opportunity projects per tenant
- **FedRAMP Compliant**: Per-tenant credential isolation and data security
- **Internal API Ecosystem**: Synchronizes with our own opportunity intelligence API, not third-party systems
- **Version-based Conflict Resolution**: Maintains full version history for all data changes
- **Enterprise Authentication**: SAML integration with corporate identity systems

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create an accessible, cloud-agnostic government contracting opportunity management CRM that enables contractors to effectively manage their selected pursuits from initial selection through award, with seamless integration to master opportunity databases.

### Mission
Deliver a comprehensive opportunity management platform that enables government contractors of all sizes to effectively track selected opportunities as projects, manage pursuit teams, coordinate capture activities, and win contracts through superior project management and workflow automation.

### Target Market
- **Enterprise government contractors** (500+ employees) managing large-scale opportunity pursuits
- **Defense contractors** requiring FedRAMP-compliant opportunity management solutions
- **Organizations managing high-volume pursuits** (1000+ concurrent opportunity projects)
- **Companies requiring enterprise authentication** (SAML integration with corporate identity systems)
- **Contractors needing comprehensive audit trails** for compliance and proposal management
