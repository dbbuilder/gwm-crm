# Critical Questions and Requirements Improvements

## Immediate Critical Questions to Answer

### 1. **Business Model and Deployment Architecture**

**Multi-Tenancy Strategy:**
- **Question**: SaaS multi-tenant system or single-tenant deployments per customer?
- **Impact**: Fundamentally affects database design, security model, deployment strategy, and pricing
- **Decision Needed**: This affects every technical decision moving forward
- **Recommendation**: Multi-tenant SaaS for cost efficiency and easier maintenance

**User Discovery Workflow:**
- **Question**: How do users initially discover opportunities to import into our CRM system?
- Answer: They find them on the existing separate site from our company but then migrate them through a click which calls the CRM API to add that opp to their flow. 

**Tenant Size and Scaling:**

- **Question**: Expected tenant size range (5 users vs 500+ users)?
- 500+ users
- **Question**: Expected number of opportunity projects per tenant (dozens vs thousands)?
- up to 1000 per tenant at one time 

### 2. **External API Integration Strategy**

**API Credential Management:**
- **Question**: Who manages external API credentials - system admins or tenant admins?
- **Options**:
  - System-wide credentials (all tenants use same API access)
  - Per-tenant credentials (each tenant provides their own API keys)
  - Hybrid approach with fallback options
- Answer: Full FedRAMP Compliance => per tenant credentials
- **Impact**: Affects security model, cost allocation, and compliance requirements

**Data Caching vs. Fresh Retrieval:**
- **Question**: Should we cache external API responses or always fetch fresh data?
- External API is our own API -- there will be a polling endpoint that controls if there is new status/docs/info for a given opportunity
- **Trade-offs**: Cost vs. data freshness vs. API rate limits
- **Decision Needed**: Affects performance, costs, and data accuracy

**API Version Management:**
- **Question**: How do we handle API version changes from external sources?
- Internal API and we will use /v###/ system management in the URLs
- **Strategy Needed**: Backward compatibility, graceful degradation, update notifications

**Cost Management:**
- **Question**: Who pays for external API usage costs?
- **Options**: 
  - Platform absorbs costs (included in subscription)
  - Pass-through billing to tenants
  - Hybrid with usage tiers
- Answer:No external APIs will be needed here
- **Impact**: Affects pricing model and system usage patterns

### 3. **Data Synchronization and Conflict Resolution**

**Synchronization Frequency:**
- **Question**: Real-time, hourly, daily, or user-configurable polling?
- **Factors**: API costs, data freshness needs, system load
- Answer: Polling planned for hourly but with light check for changes against internal API
- **Recommendation**: Configurable per opportunity project with intelligent defaults

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**
- **Question**: When external data conflicts with local overrides, what's the resolution process?
- **Options**:
  - Always preserve local overrides
  - User-guided conflict resolution
  - Automatic resolution with audit trail
  - Configurable per field type
- Answer: Conflicts ->> Versions

**Historical Data Management:**
- **Question**: How much historical external data should we store?
- **Options**: Last 30 days, 1 year, all changes forever
- **Impact**: Storage costs, analysis capabilities, compliance requirements
- Answer: Full history for the life of the oppty  once it is done and archived archive to a json or similar export format 

### 4. **Security and Compliance Specifics**

**Government Contractor Requirements:**
- **Question**: Specific compliance requirements (FedRAMP, CMMC Level, NIST frameworks)?
- **Impact**: Affects architecture, security controls, audit requirements
- **Decision Needed**: Determines deployment options (cloud vs. on-premises)
- FedRAMP for sure; possible CMMC and NIST -- add optional requirements to build out these opitons later

**Data Classification:**

- **Question**: What data classification levels must the system handle?
- **Options**: Public, FOUO, Proprietary, CUI, Classified
- **Impact**: Security controls, access restrictions, deployment constraints
- Not classified Proprietary Public and FOUO possibly CUI

**Authentication Integration:**

- **Question**: Support for CAC/PIV card authentication for government users?
- **Question**: Integration with existing corporate identity systems (Active Directory, SAML)?
- **Impact**: Authentication architecture, user experience, compliance
- No govt users but SAML integration 

### 5. **Integration and Interoperability**

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- **Question**: Should we expose APIs for third-party integrations? 
- Answer: Not yet
- **Question**: What data import/export formats should we support? JSON/XML/Excel(CSV)/PDF
- **Impact**: System complexity, competitive positioning, user adoption

**On-Premises Deployment:**

- **Question**: Do we need to support on-premises deployment for high-security environments? 
- Answer: Not yet -- should plan for later option
- **Impact**: Architecture decisions, containerization strategy, deployment complexity

**Webhook Support:**
- **Question**: Should we support incoming webhooks from external systems? 
- Answer: it will be an "internal" known API 
- **Impact**: Real-time update capabilities, system complexity

## Requirements Improvements Based on Best Practices

### 1. **Add Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**

Create a comprehensive RTM with:
```
REQ-ID | Category | Requirement | Priority | Source | Acceptance Criteria | Test Cases | Status
REQ-001 | Security | OAuth2 API Integration | High | GovWin API | Successfully authenticate and refresh tokens | TC-001 | Pending
REQ-002 | Functional | Opportunity Import | High | User Story | Import SAM.gov opportunity in <30 seconds | TC-002 | Pending
```

### 2. **Enhance User Story Documentation**

**Current Gap**: User stories lack detailed acceptance criteria and edge cases

**Improvement**: Add comprehensive acceptance criteria using Given-When-Then format:
```
User Story: As a capture manager, I need to override external opportunity values while preserving source data

Acceptance Criteria:
Given: An opportunity project synced from external source
When: I modify the estimated value field
Then: The system saves my override value separately from the external value
And: The system displays both values clearly differentiated
And: The system maintains audit trail of the override with reason
And: Future external updates don't overwrite my override unless I choose to accept them
```

### 3. **Add Detailed API Integration Specifications**

**Missing Elements**:
- Specific API endpoint documentation
- Request/response payload examples
- Error code handling matrix

- Authentication: API Key in header
- Rate Limit: 1000 requests/hour
- Request Format: JSON with specific field requirements
- Response Mapping: Map external fields to internal schema
- Error Handling: Specific retry logic for each error code
```

### 4. **Add Comprehensive Security Controls Matrix**

Map security requirements to specific controls:
```
Control Family | Requirement | Implementation | Validation Method
Access Control | RBAC with 7 role levels | Role-based permissions in DB | Automated testing + manual audit
Audit Logging | Immutable change tracking | Write-only audit tables | Log integrity verification
Data Encryption | AES-256 at rest/TLS 1.3 transit | Database encryption + HTTPS | Security scanning + penetration testing
```

### 5. **Add Performance and Scalability Specifications**
